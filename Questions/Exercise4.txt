1. What is a precompiled header? Name pros and cons:
    Allows frequently used headers to be preprocessed and compiled into a single file, which can then be reused across multiple source files

    Pros:
        Faster compilation times
        Improved build times
        Easier to maintain

    Cons:
        Increased memory usage
        Compatibility issues
        Debugging issues
        
2. Describe the layer of abstraction with your own words:
    In software engineering, abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the essential features.
    A layer of abstraction is a level of indirection between two components in a system that allows them to interact without needing to understand the details of each other's implementation

3. Name the SOLID principles and describe them briefly:
    - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): 
        A class should only be focused on responsibility

    - Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
        You should be able to add new functionality without changing the existing code (classes, modules, functions, etc.) 
    
    - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
        The behavior of the superclass should be preserved when using a subclass

    - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
        An interface should be focused on the needs of the client and it should only contain methods that are relevant to that client
    
    - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
        The details of implementation should be hidden behind abstractions, which can be easily changed without affecting the high-level modules
